						<h1>Online Safety</h1>
						
						<p>PetsonBreak.com is committed to providing a safe environment for our members to express themselves and meet new people in the community.</p>
						
						<p>To ensure safe and positive experiences for all users, we have written guidelines for our members to follow. The guidelines and tips are for pet owners, teens and members.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Tips for pet Owners</i></h4>
						
						<p>Members must be 18 years or older to join our site. If your teenager has just recently started using the internet we encourage you to talk to them about their online experience. You can use these guidelines to start the conversation with your teenager. Please review the Terms of Service with your teenager to ensure that you both understand the rules to which our members (and by extension, you as the parent of a teen under 18 years of age) are subject.</p>

						<h4><i>Not everyone on the site should be trusted.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Community based internet sites are just like neighborhoods except that they are online - make sure that you take caution in interacting with and adding members to their friends list.</p>

						<h4><i>Make sure you do not lie about your pet</i></h4>
						<p><b>Age:</b> In real life would you probably wouldn't lie about your pets age to get proper treatments from your vet so why lie about your pets their age online! While searching right mate for your pets, we have an age restriction because there are certain health problems with age in our pet and we do not realize it unless faced with some unwanted situation.</p>
						
						<p><b>Age:</b>Pedigree: It is globally unlawful to impersonate someone else; this is applicable in our industry too. PetsonBreak.com being a community of ethical and genuine pet owners does not allow such imposter's to use this platform to connect and/or execute any business. If you come across such pet owners who are swapping the pedigree papers and/or unethical business practice we request you to kindly report such details to us. PetsonBreak.com will consider such information as violation of terms of use and the same member will be terminated without prior information.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Dangers of giving false personal/pet information</i></h4>
						
						<p>Although we are a community based site and we make every effort to remove inappropriate members but you should also understand the dangers of giving fake/false pet/personal information on our website <span class="mail-link"><a href="www.PetsonBreak.com">("www.PetsonBreak.com")</a></span></p>

						<h4><i>What to do if you are bullied or harassed by another member</i></h4>
						<p>No one has a right to bully or harass another member. You should know that harassing messages can be stopped by blocking the member or reporting them for abuse. To report a member for harassment please click on the Report Abuse link on the member's personal page.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Tips for Teens</i></h4>
						
						<p>Our site is an online pet community built specifically for business, fun, passion and to connect right members for their requirements and also for you to meet new pet owners and express your interest about your pets. Before you get started we recommend that you read the following guidelines that are designed to help you have business, fun and be safe while on our site.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Think before you submit!</i></h4>
						<p>This is a pubic environment and anyone will be able to see what you add to your personal page. Do you want your friends, colleagues other members, society to see what you have written and uploaded? Think about this before you add anything.</p>
						
						<h4><i>People can be mean!</i></h4>
						<p>There are some people who join the site just so they can instigate and annoy other members. Don't fall into the trap of responding back with negativity. Click on the Report Abuse link next to the member's name to report the violation and WE will investigate the situation.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't use provocative name</i></h4>
						
						<p>Other members may get the wrong idea about who you are and what your intentions are. Additionally, accounts with inappropriate names violate our Terms of Services and will be shut down.</p>
						
						<h4><i>If it seems too good to be true it probably is.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Some people make stuff up and there are a few people who join the site in an attempt to make a quick buck. Protect yourself from scams. Don't give other members money, credit card information or any other financial information.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't lie about your age!</i></h4>
						<p>We ask your age for a reason - to protect you from mature and potentially inappropriate content. Lying about your age violates our Terms of Service and will result in your account being terminated.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't be a Bully!</i></h4>
						
						<p>This is a community based site and we encourage members to freely express themselves. Don't harass or bully another member if you disagree with them in a chat room or a forum post.</p>
						
						<p>No one, including us, likes a bully. If you act like one, we will shut your page down immediately. If you feel there is content on our site that violates one of our Terms of Service, click on the Report Abuse link and our member services tea will investigate and take appropriate action.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't mimic negative behavior</i></h4>
						
						<p>We are a community based site and this is your opportunity to show the world who you are and what you care about. Don't disrespect yourself or others by uploading inappropriate photos and/or text.</p>
						
						<p>Pages that have inappropriate posts and comments violate our Terms of Service and are shut down almost as quickly as they are build/registered</p>
						
						<h4><i>Tips for Members</i></h4>
						
						<p>Although most of our members are serious about their presence on our website, there may be some people who join the site for other reasons. We put together this guide to give you tips on how to protect yourself so that your search for the right pet mate experience can be enjoyable and safe.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Use your common sense and trust your instinct.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Meeting members online for the first time is just like meeting a stranger in a club or bar. Think about what you would do or tell someone about yourself when you first meet them. Use the same guidelines and the same common sense when you first meet someone on the internet.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't use provocative name.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Other members may get the wrong idea about who you are and what your intentions are. Additionally, accounts with inappropriate names violate our Terms of Services and will be shut down.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Take care in giving out information to other members</i></h4>
						
						<p>Be cautious about how much information you share when you meet someone new. Why not start by sending a note, an IM or an email from a third-party email address such as Yahoo or Hotmail? This will allow you to take time to get to know the person and will help you determine if they are trustworthy.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Trust yourself. If it seems too good to be true it probably is.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Although we have great and wonderful members you should be wary of those who may be making up grand stories to trick you into believing they are someone they are not.</p>
						
						<h4><i>Don't post any nudity.</i></h4>
						
						<p>Posting nudity, even if it is in the form of artistic expression, may be misinterpreted by others. Members may get the wrong idea about who you are and what your intentions are. Additionally, accounts with inappropriate photos will be shut down immediately.</p>
						
						<p>All these guidelines are put in place to remind you to use your common sense when using the internet. Remember you are in CONTROL!</p>
						
						<p>If you see inappropriate, fake content, photos or other violations of our Terms of Service report it to member services. There are links to Report Abuse in every section where there is member to member contact or where members can post content or photos. Our dedicated member services team is here to help you and to ensure that this remains a community based site.</p>
